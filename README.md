console.log("Hello world!"); 👋  

I'm a software developer with **5+ years of experience**, currently specialized in **mobile development using React Native**.

I started my journey studying Software Engineering at **Holberton School**, where I built a strong foundation in algorithms, low-level programming, backend, and full-stack development. Over time, I discovered that my real passion is building seamless and modern mobile experiences.

Today, I focus on developing complete mobile apps—from UI/UX implementation to backend integration, authentication, real-time features, analytics, CI/CD, performance optimization, and publishing to both the **App Store** and **Google Play**.

💻 Tech I work with:
- **React Native (TypeScript)**
- Expo / React Native CLI
- Zustand / Redux
- Firebase / Native Modules
- React Navigation / Animations

🚀 What I'm working toward:
Continuing to grow as a **Mobile Engineer**, mastering scalable architecture and high-quality app development, and eventually leading mobile projects end-to-end.
